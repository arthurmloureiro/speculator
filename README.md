Neural network emulation of Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models for galaxy spectra and photometry.

This repository contains the neural SPS emulation code associated with the paper [Alsing et. al 2019, arXiv 1911.11778](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11778)

Under construction: code, pre-complied emulator models, and documentation coming soon!

Meanwhile, if you read the paper and would like to collaborate on building an SPS emulator for a particular case/project, feel fre to get in touch at justin.alsing@fysik.su.se
